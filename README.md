# Assignment: Dockerizing WordPress with Dockerfile, Docker Compose, and Database Optimization

### Objective: The goal of this assignment is to Dockerize a WordPress application using best practices for Dockerfile and Docker Compose, as well as to optimize the database for improved performance. You are also required to create a Readme file to document your approach and provide additional notes related to the task.

Tasks:

### 1) Write a Dockerfile for WordPress:
Create a Dockerfile with the following content:

Create a Database and Database User:
Open a terminal or command prompt and log in to MySQL using the root password:
mysql -u root -p
Once you're logged in, you can create a database for WordPress.
Create a MySQL user and grant privileges to the user for the database
Exit MySQL:

### 2) Write a Docker Compose File:

Build the Docker Image:
From the directory containing your Dockerfile, build the Docker image

![compose1](https://github.com/Akshat338/devops-assignment/assets/91428402/6353731c-84f1-4537-a752-b03414a67c32)
![run](https://github.com/Akshat338/devops-assignment/assets/91428402/32af25f2-9dd8-4528-bd42-a843e0f407d5)
![ps](https://github.com/Akshat338/devops-assignment/assets/91428402/bae1aedf-2581-4ceb-b8a3-5f03f1112bd7)

In this task, we'll use Docker Compose to orchestrate the WordPress application and a database.

Run the Docker Compose file to start the WordPress and MySQL containers.
docker-compose up -d
![compose-d](https://github.com/Akshat338/devops-assignment/assets/91428402/40d54df2-88d7-4899-a935-e24bc4ee1cd1)

Access WordPress at http://localhost:8080

### 3) Optimize the Database for Performance:

For a WordPress site to function better and provide a seamless user experience, the database must be optimized. Following are some typical database optimization techniques and the justifications for each one:

1. Indexing
Indexes are essential for accelerating data retrieval in a database. They function as a table of contents, speeding up the process of finding specific data in lengthy tables.
Steps:
Identify frequently queried columns in your WordPress database, such as post_title, post_content, post_date, etc.
Use the CREATE INDEX statement in MySQL to create indexes on these columns.
CREATE INDEX idx_post_title ON wp_posts (post_title);
CREATE INDEX idx_post_date ON wp_posts (post_date);

2. Caching: Caching reduces the load on your database by serving pre-rendered, stored content to visitors, reducing the need for repeated database queries.
Steps:
Install a caching plugin like W3 Total Cache or WP Super Cache in WordPress.
Configure the caching plugin to enable page caching, object caching, and browser caching.
Set appropriate cache expiration times.

3. Query Optimization: Optimizing queries generated by WordPress, themes, and plugins can significantly improve performance.
Steps:
Use a WordPress plugin like "Query Monitor" to identify slow or inefficient queries.
Review the queries and assess whether they can be optimized.
Optimize queries by limiting the data retrieved (e.g., selecting only the necessary columns), avoiding costly operations, and using indexes where applicable.

4. Regular Backups: Regular backups help ensure data integrity and provide a safety net in case issues occur during optimization or other operations.
Steps:
Set up automated backups of your WordPress database using a plugin or server-side tools.
Ensure backups are stored securely, both locally and offsite.

5. MySQL Configuration: Adjusting MySQL server settings can help better allocate resources and optimize performance.
Steps:
Edit the MySQL configuration file (usually my.cnf or my.ini).
Adjust settings like innodb_buffer_pool_size to allocate more memory to the InnoDB storage engine, or key_buffer_size for MyISAM storage engine (if used).
Tweak settings like query_cache_size to control query caching.
Ensure that the configuration aligns with the available server resources and the workload.
